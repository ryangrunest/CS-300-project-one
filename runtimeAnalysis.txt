Big O Analysis of Reading the File and Creating Course Objects
Pseudocode Analysis
Reading the File:

Each line of the file is read once (WHILE NOT end of file loop).
Cost per line: 1.
Number of executions: n (number of courses in the file).
Total Cost: O(n).
Parsing Each Line:

Splitting the line into tokens (SET tokens = split(line, ',')).
Cost per line: O(k) (where k is the average number of tokens per line).
Number of executions: n.
Total Cost: O(n * k).
Checking Prerequisites:

For each course, prerequisites are checked in a loop (FOR EACH prerequisite IN prerequisites).
Cost per line: O(log n) for checking existence in the tree (or O(1) for hash table, or O(n) for vector).
Number of executions: m (average number of prerequisites per course).
Total Cost: O(n * m * log n) for tree, O(n * m) for hash table, O(n * m * n) for vector.
Inserting into the Data Structure:

Each course is inserted into the data structure.
Cost per line: O(log n) for tree, O(1) for hash table, O(n) for vector.
Number of executions: n.
Total Cost: O(n * log n) for tree, O(n) for hash table, O(n^2) for vector.
Total Running Time
Binary Search Tree: O(n * k + n * m * log n + n * log n) → Dominated by O(n * m * log n).
Hash Table: O(n * k + n * m + n) → Dominated by O(n * m).
Vector: O(n * k + n * m * n + n^2) → Dominated by O(n^2).
Advantages and Disadvantages of Each Data Structure
1. Vector
Advantages:
Simple to implement.
Efficient for small datasets.
Disadvantages:
Searching for prerequisites is O(n), which is slow for large datasets.
Inserting courses requires shifting elements, making it inefficient (O(n)).
2. Hash Table
Advantages:
Fast lookups and insertions (O(1) on average).
Efficient for checking prerequisites.
Disadvantages:
Does not maintain order, requiring additional sorting for alphanumeric order.
Memory overhead due to hashing.
3. Binary Search Tree
Advantages:
Maintains alphanumeric order naturally.
Efficient for searching (O(log n)).
Disadvantages:
Insertions and lookups are slower than hash tables (O(log n)).
Requires balancing to maintain efficiency (e.g., AVL or Red-Black Tree).
Recommendation
Based on the analysis, the Binary Search Tree is the best choice for this program. Here's why:

Maintains Alphanumeric Order: The in-order traversal of the tree naturally outputs courses in sorted order, eliminating the need for additional sorting.
Efficient Prerequisite Checking: Searching for prerequisites is O(log n), which is acceptable for large datasets.
Balanced Performance: While hash tables are faster for lookups, they do not maintain order, and vectors are inefficient for large datasets.
Thus, the Binary Search Tree strikes a good balance between efficiency and meeting the program's requirements.
